# A React template set up with vite and tooling

## Intro

This is a React template made with vite but with added tooling preconfigured. This includes:

- Eslint
- Vitest
- Tailwind
- Testing-library
- React Router
- Prettier

To use:

1. git clone
2. cd into directory
3. yarn

## Why did I create this?
After using Vite and seeing how fast it is to create a react project, I never want to go back to create-react-app again. However, Vite doesn't have tooling built into it as well as testing suites. So instead of setting this up everytime, I thought I'd just make a template for future use :)
